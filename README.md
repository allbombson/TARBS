# Thomas's Auto-Rice Bootstraping Scripts (TARBS)


## Installation:
There are currently 2 versions of TARBS:

1. On an Arch based distribution as root, run the following:

```
curl -LO allbombson.github.io/TARBS/tarbs.sh
sudo bash tarbs.sh
```
2. If have an Arch based distro and you wish to have all the tools from Black Arch + more, run the following:
```
curl -LO allbombson.github.io/TARBS/ba-tarbs.sh
sudo bash tarbs.sh
```
BA standing for Black Arch.


That's it.

## What is TARBS?

TARBS is a fork of [LARBS](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/LARBS) edited to use my configs. 90% of credit goes to Luke.I have left all his cofigs alone in here so if you want more info read up there.
## Customization

I have added a custom 2nd repo if you wish to change it just use -r2 usage is the same as -r.
